Reporting Metrics to StatsD
===========================

[StatsD] is a simple network daemon that continuously receives metrics over UDP and periodically sends aggregate metrics
to upstream services like (but not limited to) Graphite. Because it uses UDP, sending metrics data to StatsD is very
fast with little to no overhead.


### Getting Started

Kamon statsd module is currently available for Scala 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12.

Supported releases and dependencies are shown below.

| kamon-statsd  | status | jdk  | scala            | akka   |
|:------:|:------:|:----:|------------------|:------:|
|  0.6.5 | stable | 1.7+, 1.8+ | 2.10, 2.11, 2.12  | 2.3.x, 2.4.x |

To get started with SBT, simply add the following to your `build.sbt`
file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.kamon" %% "kamon-statsd" % "0.6.5"
```

Configuration
-------------

At the very basic level, you will certainly want to use the `kamon.statsd.hostname` and `kamon.statsd.port` configuration
keys to ensure your data is being sent to wherever your StatsD instance is running. Additionally to that, you can configure
the metric categories to which this module will subscribe using the `kamon.statsd.subscriptions` key. By default, the
following subscriptions are included:

```typesafeconfig
kamon.statsd {
  subscriptions {
    histogram       = [ "**" ]
    min-max-counter = [ "**" ]
    gauge           = [ "**" ]
    counter         = [ "**" ]
    trace           = [ "**" ]
    trace-segment   = [ "**" ]
    akka-actor      = [ "**" ]
    akka-dispatcher = [ "**" ]
    akka-router     = [ "**" ]
    system-metric   = [ "**" ]
    http-server     = [ "**" ]
  }
}
```

If you are interested in reporting additional entities to StatsD please ensure that you include the categories and name
patterns accordingly.


### Metric Key Generators ###

By default, the `kamon-statsd` module will use the entities' information to create a predictable metric key that follows
the pattern `application.host.category.entity-name.metric-name`, where each portion of the pattern corresponds to:

* __application__: Uses the value of the `kamon.statsd.simple-metric-key-generator.application` configuration key.
Defaults to `kamon`.
* __host__: Uses the local host name. You can also change the host value to a arbitrary value using the
`kamon.statsd.simple-metric-key-generator.hostname-override` configuration key or completely remove the host portion
from the key pattern by changing the `kamon.statsd.simple-metric-key-generator.include-hostname` configuration key.
* __category__: The entity's category.
* __entity-name__: The entity's name.
* __metric-name__: The metric name assigned in the entity recorder.

This metric key generation mechanism seems very useful and flexible, but in case it falls short for your needs then you
can create your own implementation of `kamon.statsd.MetricKeyGenerator` and let Kamon know about it by setting the
`kamon.statsd.metric-key-generator` configuration key to the FQCN of your implementation.

### Metric Senders ###
`kamon-statsd` module allows you to control the way data is flushed to StatsD server. By default Kamon is shipped with two diferent senders:

  -  `kamon.statsd.BatchStatsDMetricsSender` which batches data and sends a UDP packet every `kamon.statsd.flush-interval` or as soon as `kamon.statsd.batch-metric-sender.max-packet-size` is reached. It is advisable to experiment with both of these settings to
  find the right balance between network bandwidth utilization and granularity on your metrics data. This sender is used by default.
  -  `kamon.statsd.SimpleStatsDMetricsSender` which sends a UDP packet for each piece of data it receives.

One can choose one over another changing `kamon.statsd.metric-sender-factory` configuration key to `kamon.statsd.BatchStatsDMetricsSender` or `kamon.statsd.SimpleStatsDMetricsSender` respectively. Also custom senders can be pluged-in this way. The value for `kamon.statsd.metric-sender-factory` should represent a FQCN for a Scala object that implements `kamon.statsd.StatsDMetricsSenderFactory` interface.

### Metric Units ###

Kamon keeps all timing measurements in nanoseconds and memory measurements in bytes. In order to scale those to other units before sending to StatsD, set `time-units` and `memory-units` config keys to desired units. Supported units are:
```
n  - nanoseconds
Âµs - microseconds
ms - milliseconds
s  - seconds

b  - bytes
kb - kilobytes
mb - megabytes
gb - gigabytes
```
For example,
```
kamon.statsd.time-units = "ms"
```
will scale all timing measurements to milliseconds right before sending to StatsD.

Visualization and Fun
---------------------

StatsD is widely used and there are many integrations available, even alternative implementations that can receive UDP
messages with the StatsD protocol, you just have to pick the option that best suits you. For our internal testing we
choose to use [Graphite] as the StatsD backend and [Grafana] to create beautiful dashboards with very useful metrics.
Have an idea of how your metrics data might look like in Grafana with the screenshot bellow or use our [docker image] to
get up and running in a few minutes and see it with your own metrics!
